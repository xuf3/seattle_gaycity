Sometimes americans needs to learn they're not alone in the entire universe! When you're traveling, you let your passport at your hotel to avoid big big problems by loosing it or being stolen.

The person checking me in told me this upfront so that&rsquo;s good. Everything is very clean and well maintained. I went there on a twink night (thursdays).

,,,,,,,6,jklewissf,Disappointing\nMy husband and I are big steamworks fans and are familiar with the clubs in Berkeley and Chicago. This club was a disappointment. There is no jacuzzi which we liked in Berkeley and really impressed with in Chicago. The place was not at all crowded for the DILF event and much heavier on the D side of things. There was a lot of unprotected fucking going on. Maybe the new drugs have changed things but Berkeley was always very proactive in making sure only safe sex took place in the public areas. We both met friendly guys and got off a couple of times but all in all it was not like the other clubs where we would stay for hours. the place was reasonably clean. Parking is a problem.,None,,,
,,,,,,,7,steam.works.73,"responding to DuckRoggers2038\nWe're sorry your visit to our Seattle club was less than optimal. True, our Chicago facility is a great bathhouse. The Seattle club is a work in progress. We have major upgrades planned for Seattle soon. Until then, we continue to be confident calling our Seattle club the best bathhouse in the area. Visit us on any Saturday night and you'll see naked men of every shape, size, color, and from all walks of life.",Loves it,,,
,,,,,,,8,DuckRoggers2038,"Worst steamworks\nHere is the positive... This place has a really great steam room. It's huge and one of the best designs. However, I went there about 5 times within two weeks while visiting Seattle... Steam room lacked steam in a bad way and didn't fill up the room. The reviews of this place are accurate. There was only small crowds and most people were not friendly. The staff was friendly though. This place has the gritty and dirty feel, which is a attraction for some. But true fully it's like Seattle itself... Dark, wet, and kinda depressing. It has great mazes and this big area with a cage...lots of places to take a dude to and you don't need a room to find privacy. It also has a couple a corners with a box with see through mirrors that was cool to watch guys play in. But it falls short with the lack of a great working steam room, very dingy appearance, and fails in comparison to steamworks Chicago. It's so far off base, that if I owned this chain I would create a new brand for Seattle steamworks and not let it tarnish my franchise any longer.",Hates it,,,
,,,,,,,9,HarleyDaddy,"Aloof Unfriendly Crowd\nWhy do you go to a Gay Bathhouse? IS it to interact with other men in a positive and friendly way? If so, then this is NOT the bath for you. This facility is ""Pretty"", and very ""high designer concept"", but it is sadly lacking in real substance. There is no ""heart"" here. A stranger will not be made to feel welcome here. The general attitude here is one of ""passive indifference"". No one will be rude to you, but no one will make any effort to talk to you or make you feel welcome.. This applies to even very young very appealing men. I cannot recommend this bath to anyone until the attitude improves considerably IN this bath, it is rare to see two men actually interacting with each other - even to engage in a simple conversation. There is a lot of ""silent brooding"" going on here.",Hates it,,,

,,,,,,,11,Lakewoodwa1,"Suckfest limp @ Steamworks\nMy partner & I went to Steamworks Sat, Jan 12th to see what kind of activity Steamworks could put together from the advertised times of 3-6pm. The Suckfest webpage banner appeared on several of the different Steamworks locations so we thought it might be good because it was a company-wide event. Fat chance! Although we were told upon entering that there were about 35 guys there, I counted 14 different guys. You know it was bad if I had time to count! There were no organized events, no patronage and no employees present to run a program. So I guess Steamworks is like George Bush- if you call something Suckfest enough times, it will become that thing. Not only were the ment that were there by most terms overweight, Steamworks has changed all the lights to red bulbs and its even darker than before. Guess thats the strategy when you're not getting hot men into your failing business. I'll give it one star because it was warmer inside than on the street. Next time we're in the mood, we're heading to Club Z!",Hates it,,,
,,,,,,,12,Usermane,"Should be quarentined.\nThe place does resemble the advertised pics but have to say the pics have to be 20 years old. I have been to a few bath houses in my day and found this one to be less than desirable. Lots of cute tweekers but all of them with the same Seattle dispostition. (if you are not born and raised, you will know what I mean) It offers a steam room and a whole lot of steps in the dark. My experience was, to say the least, a huge disappointment. Most of the guys were old, fat and seemed to be missing a few genes. The others were young kids that seemed to tweeking. The place seemed to be very clean but the staff at the front desk were less than friendly. All in all I would say that it is definitely a place to visit if you want to catch something you will probably never get rid of.",Hates it,,,

,,,,,,,17,mike98312,Like stepping out of GQ magazine\nFun place if you aren't old enough to go to the gay bar but realistically I see no reason to give it such a nice review. Yes the rooms are sizeable and yes they do have good service but when you think about it they are very expensive especially when you are just looking for a quick trick and not willing to roam around a little in search of some booty. I have not seen anything there that can't be found across the street for half the price especially since nothing ever happens there and the crowd is very rude. There are a lot of teases and good looking guys that turn down other good looking guys for a quick ram from a troll that you could find at a rest stop. There are a lot of lookers there it would seem that have no intention of sleeping with anyone I have seen it on many occasions they come to watch movies and chill in the steam room I mean who goes to a bathouse without putting out?,None,,,

I ended hooking up with a really hot couple of guys then was able to lounge for awhile before somemore hot times.

While this rather small bath house has a large steam room, the two other small, under-used play spaces were nothing to brag about. It seemed as if the Seattle boyz didn't know how to use a suck ramp. The video lounge had a couple of old canvas upholstered sofas that were always wet and sticky (can you say ""scabies"", ew!). A recent Saturday night wasn't especially busy but did have a good mix of ages, races, types. The biggest turn-off was the horrible, piss-riddled bathroom. Three nights in a row produced no change.

However, the sesame grilled ahi in a soy reduction did not pair well with a somewhat cassarole style baked jasmine rice. Too many directions with the spicing: SE Asian with East Indian two very distinct flavors clashing. Sommalier was terrible. Poor wine suggestion (Sauvignon Blanc) with main course. Not a lot of good information on the wine which was served celler temperature. With the high spicing of the food, we asked the wine be chilled down to temper its cloying characteristics. Dessert was blueberry crisp and key lime cheese cake. Crisp was more like sweetened oatmeal with vanilla ice cream.

I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but only my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, India and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and India, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of it is the huge cash deposit of (Twenty One million Dollars ) ($21,0000.00) that I have with a finance Company abroad which I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 20% of the total sum for you, for your time and patience, Now you have to send reply with your full contact information for more private and confidential communication, I am waiting anxiously to pass information's to you before my last hour as i have no more time unless by God's intervention. you can reach me here on my hospital email address for more introduction about myself. mariamhana1965@gmail.com or drop your email here for me to have quick contact with you.

I go back this week with not a drink on me and the door guy has the nerve to go up to one of my friends and tell him to not let me drink more than one drink. I was embarrassed and flabbergasted at the profiling. Like I said, I had been here 30+ times and only once I got tipsy, didn't even cause any problems and all of a sudden I was ""blacklisted"". They went up to a friend and defamed me. I would totally understand if it was habitual. But this kind of embarrassment and profiling for one day?

With that being said the more we frequent these comfortable shoes the quicker we wear the bottom out of the heel to where we no longer want to slip into them. R Place is one such bar that I believe has wore me out. There is a lot of fun to be had at R Place when you first start going to the bar; current top 40 hits are played on the dance floor, strong drinks that would equal two or possibly three at other bars are being thrown at patrons and their are a lot of attractive people to be seen. As time goes on and you frequent the bar more you start to realize that you have the sudden feeling of familiarity with every person you come in contact with. This isnt because you had some wild night with numerous people throughout the bar, which is out of the question as R Place is the perfect bar to experience the legendary Seattle Freeze. This familiarity comes because the same exact people and groups of people are ALWAYS at R Place. These wolf packs of gay men roam through out the bar hungry to make their presence known by always barking the loudest. Each group generally has an alpha wolf which the others of the group follow like hungry pups behind. This alpha is the nucleus of the group; he dictates where the group stands, where the group gets a drink and when the group makes their way to the dance floor. This alpha also usually has a bloated ego and sense of importance which his young pups are drawn to because of the wide spectrum of insecurities that they all possess.",Loves it,,,

Their shows went down the crapper when they brought the california style here as It mostly caters to illlegal immigrants. Stay away from R place it's a scam besides most of the men in there act and look like women literally they really should just redecorate and call it a straight bar but that would be stupid as the gay people would mingle with the straight crowd and cause fights and more controversy to Seattle's already growing problem with street crime. Yes r place is a screwed up place now for the gay community I went there for halloween 2010 people were extremely rude, drinks watered down and expensive, the go go dancers gave me dirty looks and danced in a rude fashion that made me feel uncomfortable and molested thus insenuated that I was a paedofile as they made physical references to how children would look like if they were forced to work as sex workers.",Hates it,,,

Went upstairs to check things out and everywhere we went everyone would follow us like they were expecting something. One guy seemed like he was nice at first and telling us about people there have respect and so on. Saying that if you don't like that people are trying to join in and you say no then they will respect that, WRONG. That guy was scheming something from the beginning. We couldn't get a room because it was so packed, so we tried doing some stuff in the dark room. We were alone at one point which was nice. One guy was laying on a swing which we didn't mind him, till some people noticed us doing stuff that everyone was trying to join in and that was a total turn off and I had to tell them no and what not. I was getting pissed. I mean watching is okay but trying to get on it is not okay or tricking people so they can have their way fuck that. We are NEVER going to a gay bath house EVER! If you like being ganged on by a lot of unrespected older men than be my guest. There are only like a select few that have respect. By the way if you look young and are asian, watch your back.

As a tip, request the ""Sling rooms"" if they are available. Even if you never ever use a sling, these rooms are much more centrally located, so there is considerably more walk past traffic.

I've been there maybe a half dozen times, scattered over as many years, and overall, I'd have to say that the place is consistently a bit disappointing. The whole time, I've only messed around with a couple guys there (and they were both young and h-o-t) but they were the exception. I thought adding a steam room would be a good move but it really doesn't make up for everything else. The top floor seems to be reserved for the heavy duty party guys, and I'm not talking about Tupperware boys. I'm sure there must be some occasional sex, but for the most part it's a rather unhealthy looking assortment that seem to know each other and appear to be collectively bored. Some are decked out in leather thongs, a surprising number are staring into the glow of laptops, and someone will occasionally climb into a sling, but nothing ever seems to happen. The third floor also has a nearly pitch black maze with a collection of benches to trip over. The only thing creepier than the maze is the lingering fetid odor wafting in the hall. Creepy in that the bathroom is kept mostly clean, and the nasty smell seems to live in the hallway. The second floor has a fairly big video room, with like five off-color flat screens mounted uncomfortably high for watching the porn. The seating is built in along the walls, recreating the awkward feel of a school gym prom dance. Nobody dances here either. The first floor is where the steam room is (and the best feature of the whole place). There's also showers & lockers, and down the hall is the TV/computer room where the homeless people tend to hang out and watch Fox Sports.

Museum of Pop Culture,"325 5th Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109, Near: at Harrison St.","Seattle has a rich history in the music world, so a unique facility of this kind is a natural fit. Permanent exhibitions include a guitar gallery and artists telling the stories behind the music.","67% love it,   3 Ratings",JBC,"Don&#039;t Bother\nMy advice would be to avoid this place like the plague. They rip you off with their prices, the exhibits are mediocre at best, and their gift shoppe selection is very sparse. If you end up getting hungry and want to go to their restaurant, then you have to go pay another entry fee of about $20/person. Then once you get inside the restaurant you have to deal with the over-cooked food that is insanely overpriced. A hamburger was about $13 and it had the consistency of a rubber tyre. The only thing that this place is is a waste of Seattle taxpayer&#039;s dollars by Paul Allen.",Hates it,,,,,,,
